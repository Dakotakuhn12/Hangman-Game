// To Do List:

// Have it to where it can be played with different games modes ex: quick play, private game, single player
// Put in a room code instead of copying a link for the private game mode
// for the quick play mode put in bots that play the game against you
// style it a bunch as well
// fix when the player that joined the room wants to leave, make it so that their username doesn't say that it's still in the room.
// fix it when you try to join a room using a different username it doesn't say the room code doesn't exist and so that the room is found.
// fix so that the word when you create the room and choose the word it doesn't say select a word even though you already have one typed.
// doesn't refresh the words.
// in the dropdown not all the catergories show up even though the database is pdated.
