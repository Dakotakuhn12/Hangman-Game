// Have the difficulties appear ex. Easy Medium Hard Advanced
// For each different difficulty have one less guess for each difficulty ex: Easy - 6, Medium - 5, Hard - 4, Advanced - 3
// Have it to where it can be played with different games modes ex: quick play, private game, single player
// Put in a room code instead of copying a link for the private game mode
// for the quick play mode put in bots that play the game against you
// style it a bunch as well
