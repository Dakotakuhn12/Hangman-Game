// To Do List:

// Have it to where it can be played with different games modes ex: quick play, private game, single player
// Put in a room code instead of copying a link for the private game mode
// for the quick play mode put in bots that play the game against you
// style it a bunch as well

// fix so that the word when you create the room and choose the word it doesn't say select a word even though you already have one typed.

// in single player have it show the high score you have meaning for example if yo uwin and had one guess left and
// then the second round you get 5 guesses left after winning add them up to calculate a high schore.
// in multiplayer have it do the same thing essentially in single player except have it so that it accumulates an amount of points for each player with a leaderboard and have it so that it calculates the scores based off of how mnay guess and time you took to calculate the score also include a timer
// after so long and if they don't guess in time they lose. But if they lose but got some letters still give them points for getting some of the words.
// in quick play have it do the same thing in multiplayer just with bots playing you instead.
// design the actual game site so that we could put coby's along with jace's game.
