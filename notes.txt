To Do List:

Features:
Have it to where it can be played with different games modes ex: quick play, private game, single player
Put in a room code instead of copying a link for the private game mode
for the quick play mode put in bots that play the game against you
style it a bunch as well
in single player have it show the high score you have meaning for example if yo uwin and had one guess left and
then the second round you get 5 guesses left after winning add them up to calculate a high schore.
in multiplayer have it do the same thing essentially in single player except have it so that it accumulates an amount of points for each player with a leaderboard and have it so that it calculates the scores based off of how mnay guess and time you took to calculate the score also include a timer
after so long and if they don't guess in time they lose. But if they lose but got some letters still give them points for getting some of the words.
in quick play have it do the same thing in multiplayer just with bots playing you instead.
design the actual game site so that we could put coby's along with jace's game.


Debugging:
fix when the player that joined the room wants to leave, make it so that their username doesn't say that it's still in the room.
fix it when you try to join a room using a different username it doesn't say the room code doesn't exist and so that the room is found.
fix so that the word when you create the room and choose the word it doesn't say select a word even though you already have one typed.
doesn't refresh the words.
in the dropdown not all the catergories show up even though the database is updated.
